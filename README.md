# Arrow Barrels Mod

The Arrow Barrels mod adds specialized storage barrels to Vintage Story that can only hold arrows.  
Barrels visually change their shape depending on how full they are, providing an at-a-glance indication of stored arrows.

The mod have been extended to include barrels for storing other items:  Spears and Sticks

## Features
- Dedicated storage for arrows only (any arrow type).
- Barrels update their appearance dynamically as arrows are added or removed.
- 8 visual fill stages, from empty to full.
- Supports standard Vintage Story crate-like container interactions (shift-click to transfer items, etc.).

## Usage
- Craft or place an Arrow Barrel in the world.
- Right-click to take 1 arrow out.
- Shift Right-click the barrel to insert arrows.
- Ctrl + shift to take/insert full stacks.
- The barrel will visually update its shape as it fills up.

## Notes
- Arrow Barrels do not accept non-arrow items.
- Visual states update automatically based on the number of arrows stored.

## Compatibility
- Works with Vintage Story 1.20.0 - 1.21.5
- Should be compatible with other mods unless they replace barrel-related block/entity classes.
